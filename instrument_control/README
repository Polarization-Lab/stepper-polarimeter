These functions are all involved in instrument control.

Note: to view video feed, execute preview(vid) in the command line after initialization

The most used codes will be the following:

  initialize
    
      Self-explanatory, this initializes everything, including the camera and monochromater. This must be run before anything is done 
  
  changeWavelength.m
   
      One input of this function is the desired wavelength of the monochromator. COMmono is interface between MATLAB and device, this stays the same in function input.
  
  NI_shutter_Jake.m
  
      This open the stepper shutter. Position inputs are 0 for open shutter and 1 for closed shutter. Note: this script only works in R2020 and beyond
      so this needs to be executed externally
 
  solve_exposure
    
      These are options for finding the best exposure times. It takes a trial and error process. Input the wavelength needed and change the exposure range in the code
      Then run it over and over again until you get to the point where the exposure time/counts plot flattens. Pick an exposure time before this peak, so that is is not overexposed.
      Repeat for each wavelength needed. (Usually, do 400-800nm in 50nm increments for air measurement. Sample measurement wavelengths will differ)
      
  samplerun 
  
      This runs wavelengthSweep.m. It takes a measurement and saves an h5 file to the filepath, as well as raw image videos and intensity plot videos (runs makeamovie.m script) 
      Change filepath and enter proper wavelengths and exposure times (found from the previous code).
