Two files are needed for data analysis:
  1. air measurement hdf5 file 
  2. sample measurement hdf5 file 
  
For the structure and contents of these files, see: Wiki, File Structure and I/O (https://github.com/Polarization-Lab/stepper-polarimeter/wiki/File-Structure)

Run the following codes:

GenMuellerV2.m 

This takes an air measurement file path and a sample measurement file path 
  
    The air measurement file path is used when the code runs GenWMatrixfromStepperPars.m, which reads the fit variables saved in the h5 file from the air calibration process 
    and makes a W matrix
    
With the W matrix and the measurement, it uses eigenvalue decomposition to solve for a Mueller matrix and saves into it the h5 file, along with the coherency values
