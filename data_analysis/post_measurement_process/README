Two files are needed for data analysis:
  1. air measurement hdf5 file 
  2. sample measurement hdf5 file 
  
For the structure and contents of these files, see: Wiki, File Structure and I/O (https://github.com/Polarization-Lab/stepper-polarimeter/wiki/File-Structure)

Run the following codes:

TO ANALYZE:
GenMuellerV2.m 

This takes an air measurement file path and a sample measurement file path 
  
    The air measurement file path is used when the code runs GenWMatrixfromStepperPars.m, which reads the fit variables saved in the h5 file from the air calibration process 
    and makes a W matrix
    
With the W matrix and the measurement, it uses eigenvalue decomposition to solve for a Mueller matrix and saves into it the h5 file, along with the coherency values

DO NOT RUN THIS CODE MULTIPLE TIMES FOR SAME ROI
  The code is designed to create multiple indexes for every run, so we can get MMs for different ROI. Running it over and over again will bloat the file with the same MM. 
  Run it once, then run the next code for different visualization preferences

TO VIEW:
ViewMMh5.m

This takes the analyzed data, like the MM and coherency values from the sample h5 file, and creates the image of the MM and parameters. 
This can be run as many times as needed, as it saves the images in the filepath and overwrites with the most current run
